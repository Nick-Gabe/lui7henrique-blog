              Fundamentals:
            </a>
            <p>
              I learned about the basic structure of a React application using
              tools like Webpack, Babel, Webpack Dev server, SASS, Source Maps,
              Fast Refresh and discovered important concepts like components,
              props, states and hooks in addition to applying the TypeScript in
              the project to add static typing to the application.

              First web application:
            </a>
            <p>
              I built a complete front-end web application using concepts and
              tools from the ecosystem like as Styled Components, MirageJS,
              Context API, hooks, Axios and more.

            <p>
              I learned how Next.js transforms the way to develop front-end
              applications and discovered important concepts such as SSR and
              SSG.

              the possibility of having back-end (serverless) functions running
              in a front-end environment.

              It is very common to develop front-end applications that are not
              connected to a single back-end, so here I learned the concept of

            <p>
              I developed an interface of an administrative panel containing
              authentication flow, dashboard, listing and registration using
              Chakra UI with Next.js.

            <p>Fundamentals:</p>
            <p>
              Learned about the mobile development ecosystem with React Native,
              I learned the project structure with CLI, in addition to knowing
              the main concepts around the library such as components,
              properties, state, immutability, hooks, style and use of
              TypeScript.

              Expo and Styled Components:
            </a>
            <p>
              I had my first contact with Expo, a Framework that offers a set of
              tools and services built around React Native platforms that
              accelerate development, and also I learned to use Styled
              Components to create interfaces with the concept of CSS-in-JS,
              i.e. it allows writing CSS code inside Javascript.

              Forms and Navigation:
            </a>
            <p>
              I used React Hooks Forms with the proposal of creating flexible
              forms, with simple ways to make validation and without unnecessary
              rendering. In addition to creating navigation between mobile
              screens.

              Async Storage:
            </a>
            <p>
              I learned how to use Async Storage to store data on the
              user&apos;s device, which is a great storage strategy when there
              are not many rules and relationships involved, as the storage
              system is simple and based on key and value (key-value),
              asynchronous and persistent.

            </a>
            <p>
              I learned how to use Social Login with OAuth Authentication, an
              incredible strategy that allows you to use user data from an
              existing account, such as a Google account. Authentication with
              Social Login brought comfort to the user who does not need to
              create a new account from scratch and can go straight to what
              really matters, which is to use the App. In addition to learning
              how to use the Context API to share data with the entire
              application (or part of it).

            </a>
            <p>
              I integrated the React Native application with an API. I learned
              the HTTP protocol methods, handle requests and responses performed
              to an API, all using the Axios library.

              Animations:

            <p>
              Improved my knowledge of interface development to the next level
              knowing and applying in practice tools and techniques that will be
              present in your applications in the future applying good UX and

            <p>Offline First:</p>
            <p>
              I implemented the Offline First strategy so that some features of
              the application work without an internet connection using a more
              robust local database.

            <p>Tests:</p>
            <p>
              I learned how automated testing is an excellent strategy to ensure
              that components and functionality continue to work regardless of
              further maintenance.

            <p>Performing Apps:</p>
            <p>
              I learned how to perform applications in React Native by
              understanding how the library&apos;s internal algorithms and the
              entire component rendering flow work.

            <p>App Publishing:</p>

              I learned how to submit an Android app to the Google Play Store
              and the iOS app to the Apple Store to make our app available to
              the world.

            <p>CI/CD Flow:</p>
            <p>
              I sought to automate the process of creating the next builds for
              our applications as soon as a new version is sent to the
              repository. And for that, I implemented the CI/CD strategy, this

          GraphQL is the rising star of backend technologies. It’s a popular
          alternative for REST as an API design paradigm and is becoming the new
          standard for exposing the data and functionality of a web server.
        </p>

              I learned concepts from Node.js, how it works and the reasons why
              it was created. Study the concepts and rules behind a Rest API,
              HTTP methods, main return codes and request parameter types.

              I created my first project with Node.js from scratch, putting into
              practice all the concepts studied in the initial module.

              I learned how to create applications using TypeScript following
              code patterns, SOLID principles, and important concepts such as
              use cases, repositories, models, Node.js streams and API
              documentation with Swagger.
